With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development.
           As of 2022, around 2.16 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth. Animals' body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviors is known as ethology.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.</p>

An animal is a living creature, which is part of a group of multicellular eukaryotic organisms. These organisms have special sense organs and nervous systems and are capable of locomotion and reproduction. All animals breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide and with the exception of a few, most animals consume organic matter. 
                    Animals are very important for the environment. We need them for several things from companionship to food and even balancing the ecosystem. There are several species of animals in the world and they live on land and water. Each of these animals has a unique place in the environment and are crucial to maintain the balance of the ecosystem. And each of them has a purpose for their existence. The study of animals is called biology.Humans and animals have to learn to coexist. A healthy ecosystem is dependent on relationships between different organisms, food webs and food chains. Protecting animals is important because it could have disastrous consequences on our ecosystem. Additionally, they have an equal right to survive in this world just as much as humans.Animals are classified into two main types: vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates are animals with fur and a backbone. </p>
